# 07 — "What drove the change" asks against what

**What to build:** `What drove the change in Apple's revenue?` answers the latest revenue. Like "why did revenue drop?" and "how much did revenue change?", it names a change with no base, so it asks what to compare against.

Found by phrase coverage ([report](../../../../evaluation/phrase-coverage.md), `src/financial_analyst_agent/phrase_coverage.py`), judged by the README's [How a question is read](../../../../../README.md#how-a-question-is-read). The fix belongs in the shared reading of words both planners pass through (ADR 0010, 0011), not in the rules planner alone.

**Acceptance:** the cases below are read right and taken off `KNOWN_GAPS`; `uv run python -m pytest tests/unit/test_phrase_coverage.py` passes; `uv run python scripts/compare_answers.py` names every conversation whose answer changes, and each change is intended.

**Blocked by:** None — can start immediately

**Status:** ready-for-agent
